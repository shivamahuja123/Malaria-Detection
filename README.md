# Malaria-Detection
In this project we will implement transfer learning in deep learning to predict Malaria Disease. My main focus would be to try out some simple CNN models from scratch and a couple of pre-trained models using transfer learning to see the kind of results we get on the same dataset! We will be using open-source tools and frameworks which include Python and TensorFlow to build our models.
